            <h1>Santa Teresa Art Fair 2015</h1>
            <h2>- Sustainability -</h2>
            <p id = "themeDescription" class = "center">
                	The innovation and ingenuity of the human race has resulted in fabulous technologies that have, for the most part, made the world a better place. However, the rapidly increasing consumption of resources such as oil over the last few centuries has led to concerns over the sustainability of human practices as a whole. As of now, we as a species consume more than the Earth is capable of producing, and many fear that if we continue on our current path, future generations, perhaps even current Santa Teresa students, will face unprecedented disasters. Along with showing the various artwork created by Santa Teresa's talented students, this year's art fair explores the issue of sustainability and the challenges it poses to us as a species.
